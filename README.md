# Dynamic Maintenance of Strong Connectivity under Bounded Edge Failures and Insertions

This repository contains the full C++ implementation of the algorithms described in this paper.

## ðŸ–‹ Thesis Abstract
In dynamic networks, failures such as link breakdowns are common. The work tackles the challenge of maintaining **strong connectivity information** in directed graphs under **edge failures and updates**, using efficient preprocessing and querying strategies. It builds on recent theoretical advances and includes an original extension for answering **pairwise strong connectivity queries** under both deletions and insertions.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- **Fault-Tolerant SCC Computation**  
  Preprocesses the input graph to allow efficient recomputation of SCCs after up to `k` edge deletions.

- **Dynamic Connectivity Queries**  
  Quickly answers whether any two nodes remain strongly connected even after simultaneous deletions and insertions.

- **Efficient Algorithms & Structures**  
  Implements techniques like:
  - `k`-Fault Tolerant Reachability Subgraphs (k-FTRS)
  - Heavy Path Decomposition
  - Path-restricted SCC computations

- **Optimized for Real-Time Scenarios**  
  Enables rapid responses in failure-prone networks such as distributed systems, transportation grids, and communication infrastructures.
